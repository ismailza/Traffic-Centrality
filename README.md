# Map Centrality

## Overview

The Map Centrality project, developed by the Kolmogorov Team, is a web-based application designed to visualize and explore the centrality of various locations. Using a variety of data sources, the application calculates the centrality of locations and displays the results on an interactive map. Designed for user-friendliness and accessibility, it caters to a diverse audience including researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

This endeavor is a collaborative effort by a group of classmates: [Ismail ZAHIR](https://github.com/ismailza), [Khaoula ABBASSI](https://github.com/wahya1), [Mohamed JEBBANEMA](https://github.com/medjebb) and [El Mehdi Salah BEN SOUDA](). As students in the same class, we combined our expertise and enthusiasm to create a tool that offers insightful visualizations about the significance and connectivity of different locations worldwide.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to our teachers, who have guided us through this project with their wisdom and patience. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow under their mentorship.
